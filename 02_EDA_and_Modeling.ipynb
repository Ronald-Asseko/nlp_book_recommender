He hoped it would help them navigate the complexities of life a little more skillfully. But what started as an idea to help his own children evolved into a life guide for anyone interested in living a better life. The book discusses many of the flaws and limitations that are part and parcel of being emotional beings. It draws on the author's own life struggles and a broad knowledge base to give easily understandable analogies. It is more than just a book; it is a roadmap for life. The author is to the point and covers a diverse set of modern-day issues in a warm, conversational style. A perfect little gift for yourself or someone you know.

       ". And would like any tips on how to get her onto the habit of reading. Thank you.. Warm, Peaceful FictionHello!; ; I'm looking for fiction books that have a slow pace, and leave you feeling warm, happy, and at peace. Perhaps it follows the experiences of a main character, or explores the way of life for a group of people. Over all, I'm hoping to find a mellow, gentle fiction filled with positivity. A quiet, happy escape. Exploring the things that make being alive so wonderful. ; ; I'm not fond of persistent drama, as there is usually a lot of animosity, anxiety, and frustration going around. These don't leave you feeling very good throughout the read. ; ; Thank you for all of your recommendations! I really appreciate your help with my search :) . I am going to start reading outloud to my boyfriend before we go to bed. Suggestions please!We make efforts to spend quality time together even though we live with each other. I love books but have always read informative books that are more similar to textbooks and I don’t think he would be very interested in tech stuff. We do love documentaries about crazy people or just over all unusual history persons, could include murders or any people history deemed a bit crazy. I like fiction if it is more realistic if that makes sense? Any and all suggestions welcome I’m just not sure where to start. . Does anyone have any good bizarro fiction reads?Its a genre I've always wanted to get into, but I'm not sure where to start.. *\n",

Are there books that would make me appreciate adulthood? In my search, I've come across coming of age novels where the protagonist is either finishing high school or is just starting college. I'm past those too. Can someone please suggest books that a newly minted adult trying to adjust to the real world will enjoy? That rules out any fantasy. Science fiction is still okay if the focus is more on the people and what they go through with the sci-fi parts just there in the background. But most preferably the setting would be the real world.

Books where the protagonist and the antagonist fall in love and live happily ever after?I love books where the hero and villain fall in love, but they so rarely end up together.

I'd actually prefer if it was a subplot.; ; Also, please no r\\*pe. It makes the villain irredeemable to me, and so many recommendations I've gotten have had it.
